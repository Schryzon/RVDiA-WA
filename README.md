# RVDiA: WhatsApp Edition
Revolutionary Virtual Dialog Assistant.
Made using pure Python with Quart.

*A sequel to the Discord counterpart, [RVDiA](https://github.com/Schryzon/RVDiA),*
with the purpose of introducing her to a wider audience.

"*The success of RVDiA brought me here... but Discord wasn't enough to bring my name into the game, I have to step things up a lot!*"
-Schryzon, 2 days before the development of the project.

## Contact Her
RVDiA's phone number: `+6287716820936`
or you can skip the hassle and [chat with her right away!](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=6287716820936&text=Halo%2C%20RVDiA!)

## Wanna Collab?
Unfortunately, I'm not open to direct contributions as of now.
Though, suggestions and critics are welcome as I feel rusty when coding nowadays.

## Hosting
Hosted using the same droplet as her twin sister does, in DigitalOcean.
Using ngrok free static domain.

## Cloning
Feel free to clone, but do mind the MIT license.

In the command prompt, type in `git clone https://github.com/Schryzon/RVDiA-WA`

and make sure all the modules in `requirements.txt` are installed

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Also, don't forget to check out `.env.example` on what you need to setup.
